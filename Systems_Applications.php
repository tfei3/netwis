					<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">Advances in
wireless networking technology as well as the development in
lower-power devices and ubiquitous Internet have brought wireless
techniques beyond conventional data communication and information
technology. Driven by real-world demands, such as manufacturing, health
care, and robotics,&nbsp; power surveillance systems, and many emerging
applications are characterized by time- and data-sensitive
applications.&nbsp; We are currently investigating several aspects
toward system design and applications, which not only provides an
opportunity to practice our study and to collaborate with other groups,
but also offers a platform to have undergraduate students participated
in research activities. The emphasis on this research is on developing
a
personal indoor wireless sensor network and applying to wireless
network controlled systems.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"></span></p>

						<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">An
interesting and
potential application of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">visually
(or virtually) tracking the person's daily interaction with his/her
habitat and monitoring the indoor conditions by the help of the sensors
embedded throughout the home, building, etc. One interesting example of
such applications is </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">on Aging Services
Technologies with a specific focus on In-Home Health Care Solutions for
people of ages 65 and older. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">These
applications naturally brings in the need for deployment of an
"in-home" wireless sensor network. However, indoor environment is not a
</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">benign
networking
environment where several obstacles </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">may
render wireless communication impossible between node pairs. In
addition, due to limited and irregular sensing ranges, placement of
sensors becomes an important and challenging problem which may impact
the accuracy of the collected data.</span>

In the general case, basic parameters for an indoor sensor network can
be impacts of node placement (position, orientation), transmission
range / sensing range ratio, distance of reachability and degree of
connectivity. Another interesting topic would be investigating how to
preserve reliability within an in-home wireless sensor network with
updated decisions on parameter settings (radio, llc/mac, routing,
application etc). </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif">This
would be very useful since home itself is like a living organism.
Furniture might move, neighbor might start to emit&nbsp; noise at
certain
hours, heat can change etc. Or, increased reliability might be needed
when an abnormal state is&nbsp; detected.</span><big>

					<p>iSpace is a network based integrated navigation system for unmanned ground 
						vehicles (UGV) developed at the Advanced Diagnosis, Automation, and Control (<a href="http://www.adac.ncsu.edu/">ADAC</a>) 
						Laboratory. It has different modules combined together to guide a UGV from one 
						point to another in the space of interest, where the navigation intelligence 
						lies on a controller away from the UGV. There are some rules to decide the 
						motion. The UGV has to reach the destination as quickly as possible and 
						avoiding the obstacles in the space. The destination point is chosen by the 
						user via any remote computing interface in the world using the iSpace GUI on 
						the Internet. The figure below explains iSpace structure.

						STEP2 is integrated with iSpace to provide dynamic and adaptive protection over 
						the wireless part between the controller and robots. The whole iSpace flow 
						diagram with the STEP2 is as follows. Presently, iSpace supports only 
						confidentiality feature by using Data encryption standard (DES) and 3DES 
						encryption/decryption algorithms.

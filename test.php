			 style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/%7Ewwang"
			 >Dr. Wenye Wang,</a><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;
			</span>is focused broadly on in-depth understanding, algorithm and
			protocol design in mobile wireless networks<span
			 style="font-weight: bold;">. </span>Our vision is that by developing
			new models, measuring experimental results, and understanding basic
			properties of wireless networks in different circumstances, it is
			possible to design algorithms, protocols, and architectures that enable
			a wireless network to have robust architecture, better performance, and
			more flexibility. With underlying network architecture, applications
			beyond communications and networking can be developed for large-scale
			distributed, intelligent systems. <br />
			</p>
			<p class="style16">Our lab members include undergraduate students who
			gain their experience in research and prepare for their graduate study,
			and graduate students who aim to make novel contributions to wireless
			networking area. Currently, we are focused on the issues like mobility
			modeling and characterization, dynamic security management framework
			for single- and multi-hop wireless networks, network reliability and
			resilience in the presence of failures and abnormality, performance
			analysis, and design of algorithms and protocols in order to optimize
			networking performance. <br />

			<p class="style16">Since January 2006, we have moved to new Engineering
			Building II, Centennial campus, North Carolina&nbsp; State University.

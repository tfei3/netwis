<p> The understanding of dynamics and randomness in mobile wireless
networks can enable revolutionary versus evolutionary advances in the
design and performance of a network. Our group is committed to the
discovery, modeling, and investigation of basic properties, interaction
among different network dynamics&nbsp; and requirements, with an
emphasis on node mobility, routing operation, network topology, and
performance.&nbsp; In particular, our efforts are being placed on
developing new models of user mobility/profiles, which present the most
challenges in wireless networks.&nbsp; Areas of current research
interest include the following:<br />

<h5>Mobility modeling and characterization</h5>
<p> Mobility modeling is a fundamental issue in wireless mobile
networks, which has a significant impact on research areas, such as
routing protocol design, network performance evaluation, link and path
lifetime analysis, network connectivity study and network topology
control. Therefore, we are actively working on how to design a mobility
model which can effectively mimic smooth transient moving behaviors of
mobile nodes and have the desired steady state properties, such as
stable node speed and uniform node distribution, is a challenging
issue. We aim to design a mobility model which can i) achieve the above
goals, ii) integrate a variety of nice properties of existing mobility
models and iii) be flexible to mimic the realistic network scenarios. </p>

<p>In order to provide better performance and quality of service, we
develop a framework to capture user mobility profile (UMP) which is a
combination of historic records and predictive patterns of mobile
terminals&nbsp; and to estimate service patterns and locations of
mobile users, including descriptions of location, mobility, and service
requirements. We aimed to develop new mobility model to characterize
not only stochastic behaviors, but historical records and predictive
future locations of mobile users as well, that is, to incorporate
aggregate history and current system parameters to acquire UMP.&nbsp;
We are also interested in the characterization of mobility uncertainty
and its impact on network topology.</p>

<h5> Link and path dynamics in multihop networks </h5>
<p> Understanding the link and path stochastic properties can greatly
help researchers design mobility-resilient MANETs, maximize routing
performance, optimize topology control, and achieve the desired network
performance. </p>

<p>We are focused on developing new models to study link and path
properties under the circumstances such as varying radio link
conditions, node mobility, geographical constraints, and interferences.
In particular, we aim to study probabilistic and&nbsp; statistical
properties of link/path lifetime, link/path reliability in the presence
of node or link failures due to radio channels and node mobility.
Currently, we are developing an analytical model of the reliability
problem in wireless ad hoc networks, as well as algorithms for
computing two-terminal reliability in mobile ad hoc networks.</p>

<h5>Node behavior and network topology </h5>
<p> Compared with wired network, wireless ad hoc networks are more
vulnerable to malicious attacks as well as failures due to their unique
features, such as constrained energy, error-prone communication media
and highly dynamic network topology. Especially, every node (or end
user) may have quite different “social” behaviors. For example, selfish
nodes refuse to forward packets for other nodes in order to save their
own energy. While, with no intention for energy-saving, malicious nodes
may launch all kinds of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by replaying,
reordering or/and dropping packets from time to time, and even by
sending fake routing messages.

As we known, the cooperation of mobile nodes is
critical to the normal operation of multi-hop wireless networks, thus
all aforementioned misbehaviors have prompted open challenges to many
issues, such as protocol design, service availability, and topology
management, in mobile ad hoc networks. Therefore, we are investigating
node behaviors in order to design a general node model so that we can
have an in-depth understanding on the evolution of different node
behaviors and their impact to network survivability. The modeling and
analysis of node behaviors will yield new insights into the analysis
and design of resilient wireless multi-hop networks. </p>

<h5>Interaction of protection and performance </h5>
<p>Rapid and widespread deployment of Wireless Local Area Networks
(LANs) offers great convenience to access the Internet via wireless
devices such as laptop computers and portable data assistants (PDAs)
users. However, wireless LANs are vulnerable to malicious attacks due
to their shared medium in unlicensed frequency spectrum. Therefore,
strong security features are required for a variety of applications in
wireless LANs. Unfortunately, secure communications are not gained for
free in wireless networks because all security protocols require
transmission of users' credentials for identity verification, control
messages, as well as data encryption/decryption which cause degradation
in quality of service (QoS). In addition, with the increasing demand
for mobile applications, while security protocols are expected to be an
integral part of network protocols, they should not undermine the usage
of wireless networks because of their effects on system performance.
Therefore, our focus is to investigate, via modeling, analysis, and
experiments, to what extent system performance can be impacted by
security protocols with respect to mobility scenarios, heterogeneous
networks, and different applications.</p>

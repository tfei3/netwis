  <p> We would be glad to provide research assistantship to potential
Ph.D. students, and exceptional M.S. students. In the process of
selecting research assistants, research interests are the most
important factor, which is a mutual match between RA and advisor. You
can find useful information on our "Research" section and
"Publications". The research on wireless networking in our group draws
on computer networks, wireless communications, security issues
(cryptography), network topology (graph theory), randomness in networks
(stochastic processes), simulations tools (NS2 and OPNET), and drivers
(hands-on experience building wireless networks). The more you know
about these areas, the easier it will be for you to make progress. If
you are seriously considering working with me, you might want to read
some of my latest publications, show me how you understand the problem
by pointing out their limitations. Regarding whether there are RA
positions or not, students are encouraged to contact me. Sometimes, I
might not respond to your request immediately; however, I will keep
your files on my waiting list (this is not just for courtesy). Once we
have positions, you will be contacted. <br>

<br>
As of October 2008, we have two opennings for research assistants, preferrably students with either solid theoretical background on networking or system integration of hardware and software for power-system communications. This is part of our efforts on the newly funded NSF Engineering Research Center (ERC)  <a href="http://www.freedm.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">FREEDM</a> at NC State University.

<blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;">
  <p>In the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering,
independent study are open to senior Master students (that is not
first-semester or first-year graduate students) and junior Ph.D.
students. Independent sstudy projects are one-semester, letter-graded,
courses, report-based courses. Students who are interested in
research,&nbsp; have a solid background on networking, and know how to
work on &nbsp;loosely-defined projects are encouraged to contact
faculty members for independent study. The basic requirements of
conducting independent study are: 1) your cumulative GPA is above 3.3;
2) you have taken at least 3 networking related courses; 3) you are
prepared to dedicate 10 hours per week on the project.&nbsp;</p>
